## Section 1: Data Types and Operations Pt. 1

### Question 1 
**Create the variables with the following composition:**  
1. A vector containing each letter of your first name as its elements.  
2. A variable that contains your name concatenated from the vector created in (1)  
3. A variable containing a sequence from 100 to 120.  
4. Create a matrix of 3x3 dimensions that contains the even sequence of numbers starting from 2.  
5. Assign names to the variables.  


```{r }
#### Start solution ####
first_name <- c("M","A","K","M","A","L")
class(first_name)
```


```{r }
Concat_firstname = cat(first_name)
```


```{r }
X<- 100:120
```


```{r }
data<- seq(2,18,2)
matrix <- matrix(data, nrow=3, ncol=3)
```


```{r }
dimnames(matrix) <- list(c("r1","r2","r3"), c("c1","c2","c3"))
matrix
```


```{r }
#### End solution ####
```

### Question 2
**Create a factor variable emp_status:**  
1. Containing the categorical variables: Employed, Unemployed, Self-Employed, with each level appearing atleast more than 2.  
2. Display the levels and the factor variable as a table.  
3. Unclass the elements of the factor variable.  


```{r }
#### Start solution ####
```


```{r }
emp_status <- factor(c("Employed", "Unemployed", "Employed",  "Unemployed", "Self-Employed", "Employed", "Self-Employed", "Unemployed", "Employed", "Unemployed", "Employed", "Self-Employed"))
```


```{r }

```


```{r }
#### End solution ####
```

### Question 3
**Create a dataframe object called bank_customers:**  
1. the data frame will have three columns: CustomerID, hasAccount, totalBalance  
2. Fill the data as follows  
    a. Alicia does not have an account. She is here for inquiry   
    b. Nancy is here to check on her account balance of USD 10,000.  
    c. Fernando is here to deposit USD 100 in his account which had no balance.  
    d. Louis will withdraw all his money from the account that had USD 2,000.   
    e. Diane is here for information.

4. Print the number of rows, columns and names for the data frame.  


```{r }
#### Start solution ####
```


```{r }
Bank_customers <- data.frame(customerid="", hasAccount="", totalBalance="")
```


```{r }

bank_customers <- data.frame(customerid="Nancy", hasAccount=T, totalBalance= 10000)
bank_customers <- data.frame(customerid="Fernando", hasAccount=T, totalBalance=  100)
bank_customers <- data.frame(customerid="Louis", hasAccount=T, totalBalance= 0)
bank_customers <- data.frame(customerid="Diane", hasAccount=NA, totalBalance= NA)
```


```{r }
bank_customers <- data.frame(customerid= c("Alicia", "Nancy", "Fernando", "Louis", "Diane"), hasAccount=c(F,T,T,T,NA), totalBalance= c(NA,10000, 100, 0,  NA))

for (i in seq(2, 100)) {
  if (any(x == i)) {
    prime_numbers = c(prime_numbers, i)
    x = c(x[(x %% i) != 0], i)
  }
}
print(prime_numbers)
```
